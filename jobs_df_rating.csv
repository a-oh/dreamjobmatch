San Francisco
Remote (US/Canada)
Full-time
Haskell, TypeScript, Nix, Swift
Mercury is building a bank for startups. We launched about a year ago with the basic functionality of a bank, and now we’re refining our product and building out new features. Thankfully, our customers seem to like what we’ve built so far:
Technically, we’re working on these challenges:
Frontend—React, Typescript, Redux: Creating a beautiful user interface. We iterate on designs and don’t compromise until we have a great product.
Backend—Haskell, Yesod, Persistent: Integrating with banking services and third party APIs to accurately track financial data and make payments.
Operations—Nix, Postgres, AWS: Maintaining a stable, secure fleet of servers.
Mobile—Swift, Kotlin: We released a native iOS App in May, and we plan to develop an Android app as well.
As a backend engineer, you’ll do things like:
Provide a backend to our iOS and web frontends, to do things like search transactions or send wire transfers
Integrate with third party APIs, to do things like send checks or validate SWIFT codes
Build admin tools, to do things like identify fraudulent customers or help manage accounts
While you would primarily work with Haskell, you’d preferably learn enough React and TypeScript to construct simple admin pages. The ideal candidate has done full-stack or backend engineering before, and is familiar with or wants to learn about Haskell.
Challenge.
We’re shaking up one of the least innovative, most powerful industries around, eliminating pain points faced by every startup, and filling a crucial missing piece in the tech ecosystem.
Building a bank from the ground up is a big project; the product is complex and cannot break, there are stringent regulations, and we’ll have to outcompete some of the largest, most entrenched corporations in the world. But overcoming these challenges means we’ll have built something that lasts.
Impact.
Working on a lean, self-motivated team means autonomy, broad experience across projects, and seeing your contributions directly shape the product and impact users.
Working on a greenfield project means you’ll have to make foundational decisions; starting from scratch requires more thought than adding to existing infrastructure, and your architectural choices will serve as the bedrock of future development.
Quality.
Building things correctly is fundamental to being a bank. There’s no room for sloppy code or technical debt, which means doing things like using static typing and immutability, designing database schemas with checks and foreign key constraints, and carefully reviewing teammates’ code.
One of the core complaints about banking is usability, so we try to think hard about how to build features that users love; see our blog post on our date picker for an example. Our goal is to be proud of what we’ve crafted.

Mercury is building a bank for startups. We launched about a year ago with the basic functionality of a bank, and now we’re refining our product and building out new features. Thankfully, our customers seem to like what we’ve built so far:
Technically, we’re working on these challenges:
Frontend—React, Typescript, Redux: Creating a beautiful user interface. We iterate on designs and don’t compromise until we have a great product.
Backend—Haskell, Yesod, Persistent: Integrating with banking services and third party APIs to accurately track financial data and make payments.
Operations—Nix, Postgres, AWS: Maintaining a stable, secure fleet of servers.
Mobile—Swift, Kotlin: We released a native iOS App in May, and we plan to develop an Android app as well.
We’re looking for someone who is comfortable working across the stack. The ideal candidate has done full-stack development before, and is excited to learn and work with Haskell, React, and TypeScript.
Challenge.
We’re shaking up one of the least innovative, most powerful industries around, eliminating pain points faced by every startup, and filling a crucial missing piece in the tech ecosystem.
Building a bank from the ground up is a big project; the product is complex and cannot break, there are stringent regulations, and we’ll have to outcompete some of the largest, most entrenched corporations in the world. But overcoming these challenges means we’ll have built something that lasts.
Impact.
Working on a lean, self-motivated team means autonomy, broad experience across projects, and seeing your contributions directly shape the product and impact users.
Working on a greenfield project means you’ll have to make foundational decisions; starting from scratch requires more thought than adding to existing infrastructure, and your architectural choices will serve as the bedrock of future development.
Quality.
Building things correctly is fundamental to being a bank. There’s no room for sloppy code or technical debt, which means doing things like using static typing and immutability, designing database schemas with checks and foreign key constraints, and carefully reviewing teammates’ code.
One of the core complaints about banking is usability, so we try to think hard about how to build features that users love; see our blog post on our date picker for an example. Our goal is to be proud of what we’ve crafted.

Are you an individual with a passion for cloud technologies and how you deliver services across the world? If you have built and led teams to execute on a complex, multi-disciplinary work in the development of a cloud platform, join us to have a direct impact on how we serve Twitter!

Job Description
Our company's purpose is to serve the public conversation. The Platform team helps serve that conversation by enabling us to deliver a reliable service to all our customers across the world at high quality and cost effectively. We operate our own data centers at Twitter and have recently partnered with AWS (Amazon Web Services) to deliver our real-time services through the cloud (https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-taps-aws-for-its-latest-foray-into-the-public-cloud/). This enables us to serve our customers from data centers closer to them. We deploy in our data centers proprietary and open source solutions for messaging, graph storage, database clusters, observability, etc. that partners organizations at Twitter build upon to deliver great new products and features.
We run all services at Twitter with a strong focus on security and privacy. Uptime is critical, so is ease-of-use for our services. With our foray into the hybrid cloud, abstracting away the complexity of managing the data center and the cloud offerings serves to simplify how our customers in the consumer and revenue product organizations build products. It is critical that we enable a high velocity in product development.
The Platform Product organization is a critical team that we’ve assembled recently to provide direction and a product lens on all the work the platform organization does at Twitter, from data to analytics, storage to data centers, graph technologies, to networking and data centers. With every product we ship to our internal customers, we provide an enabling environment to build exciting experiences for our customers. Areas of responsibility include:
developing a vision for the cloud platform that supports the mission of Twitter of serving the public conversation
advising on new feature development and product roadmaps
providing a particular focus on delivering new capabilities to our product managers
proactively identifying potential gaps/risk areas and opportunities for driving cross-functional collaboration in these areas, such as developing product offering;
creating aspirational goals and partnering closely with Product and Engineering to create a roadmap that unlock capabilities for our partner organizations
By working together, we create the most capable and cost-efficient platform in an innovative, experiment-rich, and fast-paced environment.

deepening the Platform’s working relationship with the Consumer and Revenue Product and Engineering leadership and to ensure product roadmaps enable innovation and critical data-centric thinking;
cultivating partnerships with teams working across the whole stack from containers (Kubernetes) to infrastructure teams responsible for reliable logging, observability and alerting, while strengthening flows of communication and dialogue;
collaborating cross-functionally with our Legal, Public Policy, and Communications teams on product launches;
considering both organic and non-organic opportunities and being opinionated about cost/benefit tradeoffs
building a growing team of direct reports (Product Managers) through diligent hiring, direct mentoring, and a comprehensive staff development plan and the next level of managers;
being responsible for the team’s performance and eliminating blockers that may prevent Product Managers from executing on their roadmap and shipping product;
marketing internally with the team the set of solutions, making sure that partner organizations are informed of the offered capabilities and consulted on future features;
keeping engineering at a high level of efficiency by removing roadblocks, ruthlessly prioritizing feature set and product development and driving accountability on execution and delivery dates
You will report directly to Richard Rabbat, Head of Product, Platform.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses.

Integrating health informatics into all projects to create platforms for data…","The Global Health Informatics Technical Advisor is a vital role to the strategic growth of the health informatics portfolio in Global Strategic Information (GSI). It is increasingly critical that health information is collected at the clinical level with ease, ensuring high quality data. This information must be easily accessible at the clinic, local, regional and national levels. Integrating health informatics into all projects to create platforms for data collection, analysis, and use allows the appropriate staff to use and interpret the data to improve programs and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, health informatics may be able to solve health problems that cannot be solved in any other way, for example tracking lab specimens between sites. This position will be integrally involved in all GSI health informatics projects and will lead and support current projects, as well as pursue new opportunities for funding and expansion.

This Informatics Technical Advisor will be supervised by the GSI Technical Director for Global Health Informatics. To be successful in this position, the candidate must be an experienced professional who knows how to apply theory and put it into practice with in-depth understanding of the professional field; independently performs the full range of responsibilities within the function; possesses broad job knowledge; analyzes problems/issues of diverse scope and determines solutions.

Specifically, the Informatics Technical Advisor will provide technical oversight of informatics-related aspects of UCSF GSI projects, such as innovative data collection systems, data warehousing, and dashboard development with tools such as Power BI. Additionally, this position will lead the development and implementation of international health messaging standards (FHIR, HL7 etc.), standardized terminologies, health information exchanges, master patient indices and deduplication/linkage of clients. Depending on time and project portfolio, the candidate may be responsible for the direct implementation of some of these projects. The person will furthermore provide technical assistance (TA), training and mentorship to beneficiaries of CDC-funded projects, such as host governments, local and regional governments, implementing partners and universities – based on TA requests. When needed, the person will lead the recruitment of additional informatics capacity for specific projects and provide technical oversight and supervision. Additionally, the individual will be responsible for data analysis as needed.

Additionally, this person will utilize project management frameworks and methods to manage health information system projects, as well as provide technical support across GSI projects. The person will lead the writing of grant applications, with particular attention given to technical health information sections and budgets, compose quarterly and annual reports, and scopes of work for health informatics projects. The successful candidate will be able to manage projects of diverse scope, size, impact budget and project team size.

This is a full-time one-year contract position ending on 3/31/2022, with likelihood of extension based on funding.

ABOUT US:
Braintrust (usebraintrust.com) is a user-controlled talent network, where you keep 100% of what you earn and actually get to own the platform. We've been onboarding some big clients and specifically need a Full Stack Software Engineer for our client.
ABOUT OUR CLIENT:
Our Client is building a digital currency that will have real-world value, enabling broader economic prosperity by giving people autonomy and control of their money. The currency will provide people with a hyperinflation-protected savings account to help them protect and use their money globally. The currency is being designed to be stable, open to all, and massively scalable, with a separate token that will reward users who support the network.
THE OPPORTUNITY:
Braintrust is helping our client match to individual contributors and tech leads. All new team members should expect to spend the majority of their time implementing. They hire highly productive engineers with good judgment, which means you need to either be substantially experienced or otherwise unusually skilled in software engineering.
Our current and upcoming work includes:

mobile and web user interfaces
back-end services
data and database engineering
system architecture

As a Full Stack engineer, you will:

work on the Reserve mobile app and associated web portal, front and back end
build in React Native, React.js, and Flask (Python)
THE KIND OF ENGINEERS THEY HIRE:
Our client would be very excited to meet you if:

You take pride in figuring things out and making things work, and once you accept a challenge you enjoy getting into all of the little details and becoming a micro-expert in order to nail it.
You can show us cool things you have built yourself in your own time, and/or a long list of projects you’ve had significant ownership over professionally that are related to the work we are doing (mobile, web, smart contracts).
You are kind, conscientious, thoughtful, cooperative, and communicative.
You have found ways of spending time, effort, or money on improving the world in a meaningful way (i.e. not just virtue signalling, though we don’t mind if you do that too).
When we talk to you about something we are building, worrying about, or planning, you quickly understand what we are describing and have productive things to say.
You have honed your ability to self-manage, so that when you take on relatively abstract projects you turn them into concrete, sensible plans and bring them to completion - or if they end up not making sense you realize that quickly and help the team adjust course.
You reliably accomplish impressive amounts of important progress on what really matters, whether it’s figuring things out, implementing, educating, evaluating new team members, or anything else that comes up.
You prefer the startup life of challenges, uncertainty, invention, chaos, impact, responsibility, and autonomy, over the big-company life of predictability, bureaucracy, clarity, brand recognition, nice offices, and policy.
You have enough relevant experience that you can quickly come to solid plans for how to implement whatever you are working on, and your code naturally matches or raises the bar of maintainability we achieve.
ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS:
Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff. We will answer your questions about the project, and our platform. If we determine it is the right fit for both parties, we'll invite you to join the platform and create a profile to apply directly for this project.
C2C Candidates: This role is not available to C2C candidates working with an agency. If you are a professional contractor who has created an LLC/corp around their consulting practice, this is well aligned with Braintrust and we’d welcome your application.
Braintrust values the multitude of talents and perspectives that a diverse workforce brings. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or protected veteran status.
