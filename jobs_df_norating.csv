In 2019, global battery production could power ~5 million EVs, however the equivalent of ~1 in every 6 batteries were scrapped in production. That’s ~$4 Billion of waste in 2019, due largely to insufficient data and analytics in production. Batteries are fundamental to our clean energy transition, but unless we change the status quo, their cost will remain a major barrier.

About Feasible, Inc.
Our mission is to accelerate the clean energy transition by decreasing the cost of battery manufacturing. We are pioneers in advanced process inspection & intelligence solutions, enabling our customers to “See Batteries Differently.” Our EchoStat platform uses ultrasound and data analytics to deliver unique, valuable insights that create value in battery production by speeding up time-to-market for new batteries, accelerating yield ramp for new production processes, and improving steady-state productivity.

Since inception, Feasible has received over $9M in grants and equity funding from Chrysalix Ventures, Incite Labs, NSF, DOE (ARPA-e), California Energy Commission, Elemental Excelerator, Activate (formerly Cyclotron Road), and others. We have active validation programs with leading battery manufacturers and automakers, and are deploying our first commercial systems this year.

Our Culture and Values
We are dedicated to building a world-class company that will improve the world.
We work closely on a foundation of mutual trust and data-driven decisions.
We value personal growth, continuous learning, safety, and inclusion.
We believe the most innovative teams seek out, welcome and celebrate all forms of diversity.

Role
As a data scientist at Feasible you will join a small, nimble team of engineers creating cutting-edge battery inspection equipment. You will be an integral part of analyzing the data produced with this equipment, developing a deeper understanding of the data's relationship to the battery's production history and performance, and creating tools and techniques to achieve those goals.
On a typical day, you may: perform investigative analysis on experimental data; design and implement algorithms for distilling ultrasonic signals into meaningful features, and correlate those features with performance data; build analytics tools and visualizations to empower our engineers and customers; optimize, automate, and streamline our analytics pipeline, and integrate the pipeline with real-time data streams; or communicate your work to stakeholders with varied backgrounds.
You value careful listening, thoughtful questions, and data-driven discussions. You are comfortable with gathering and distilling information to drive the direction of open-ended projects.

By combining deep expertise in molecular biology with advanced computational biology and machine learning techniques to recognize disease-associated patterns among billions of circulating, cell-free biomarkers, we are developing simple and accurate blood tests for early cancer detection and integrating the actionable insights into health systems to operationalize a machine learning feedback loop between care and science.

By building comprehensive discovery datasets and modeling critical biological systems, Freenome is learning what biological changes are present within the blood between a variety of different disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infections, drug response, and aging. The synthesis of Freenome's datasets, cross-functional technical expertise, and audacious mission to discover biological truth, we seek to improve the lives of millions through early detection and early treatment of disease.

Director Partner Development,Datometry,"San Francisco, CA","Strong background in data or database-related enterprise software sales.
You manage the existing partnerships with our cloud vendors and help accelerate…","Datometry changes how the world uses data warehousing technology. Specifically, the replatforming of existing applications is critical to fast and effective adoption of public cloud. However, conventional replatforming has been a costly and time-consuming manual process. In a space that hasn't seen any innovation in decades, Datometry is a game changer. Our virtualization platform breaks open data silos and lets enterprises take full advantage of the rapidly expanding ecosystem of cloud data management.

At Datometry we pioneered the virtualization of entire data warehouse systems so existing applications run natively on cloud technology — without changes. With Datometry enterprises not only save millions of dollars but get to the cloud at a fraction of the time. Our customers and partners are some of the most well-known Fortune 500 and Global 2000 enterprises in the US and around the world.

Role Summary

Datometry works in close collaboration with both cloud providers as well as services organizations. We empower our cloud partners in a unique way to onboard the most critical data estates of their enterprise customers. For our services partners, Datometry is a unique competitive differentiator that puts them in the Pole Position — not only for the immediate replatforming but also for a broader modernization initiative. In the role of the Director Partner Development, you are Datometry's ambassador to its partner organizations. You manage the existing partnerships with our cloud vendors and help accelerate activities with a variety of high-profile system integrators. You coordinate joint activities and ensure close collaboration between Datometry and the partner. The Director Partner Development is central to partner-led lead generation.

In this position you focus on making connections with people, motivating and inspiring them to achieve results. Poise and an engaging, empathetic communication style based on natural warmth and enthusiasm is the key to achieving the goals of this job. The work involves driving toward results by enrolling the commitment and buy-in of others. While the job requires strong initiative and self-direction, results are only achieved with and through people. A sincere appreciation for people and how they are each uniquely motivated is the foundation for designing and implementing interactive communication and decision-making processes. Knowledge and skill in how you successfully influence and persuade others by understanding how their individual needs and motivations link to goals.
The job requires a high degree of selling, whether of ideas and policies within the organization, or products or services in the marketplace. The job environment is fast paced and results-oriented. While there is urgency to goal achievement, responsibility for the achievement of results needs to be shared and effectively delegated when necessary. Initiating projects and processes beyond established organization practices will often require training and developing others, and enlisting their support by using a ""selling"" rather than ""telling"" communication style.

A self-confident, extroverted style that can enliven, engage and positively impact individuals and groups is essential. Because of the highly dynamic nature of the nascent cloud database market, goals and desired results can change quickly. Therefore, this position requires regularly meeting and pro-actively establishing relationships with new groups in the partner organization. This position is pivotal for the success of the entire sales organization and highly impactful.

Amplitude's mission is to help companies build better products. By building best-in-class teams, we create best-in-class products that customers love. We approach challenges with humility, we take ownership over our work, and our growth mindset pushes us to constantly improve ourselves, each other, and the value we bring to customers.

As a Senior Product Manager leading our Data Hub team, you will collaborate with a smart, friendly cross-functional team to help make it effortless for our customers to ingest behavioral data and maintain data accuracy to drive adoption of the Amplitude platform

As a Senior Product Manager, you will:

Own our data pipeline and connectors end-to-end: creating the vision, setting strategic direction, and successfully delivering key product outcomes
Identify and prioritize partner technology integrations to enable thousands of customers to send terabytes of data (e.g. integration partners: customer data platforms, data warehouses, etc)
Solve complex problems – particularly in ingestion, federation and transformation of data – with an eye towards innovation
Orchestrate the delivery of amazing workflows and improvements for self-serve options by partnering cross-functionally with engineering, design, marketing, alliances, sales, customer success
Participate in research and testing (we spend lots of time talking directly to our customers!) to understand customer pain and identify opportunities for improvement

You'll be a great addition to the team if you have:

Embrace the customer as part of the team. We believe you don't build what the customer wants, but what the customer wants to become. To create that future, you first have to be an expert in the problem. You interact with customers directly - proxies don't work - so you always gather first-hand feedback. If you don't define the problem correctly, everything else is useless.
Empower everyone to be a leader. We believe teams closest to the problem are best suited to make the hard decisions quickly. We don't institute stage gates for a reason - you are given autonomy to ensure we are always progressing forward. However, no individual alone is responsible for making every decision. To be a leader means regularly seeking out the opinions of others and giving everyone a stake in the outcome.
Inspire through storytelling. We believe it is our responsibility to motivate through memorable stories that build a deep understanding of our users' experience. You should tell stories to communicate strategy and inspire the outcomes we want to create for our customers. Building a product is about envisioning some future state, and stories can help people relate to where we are and where we are going.
Learn through frequent iteration. We believe that rapid iteration is the #1 indicator of success. You strive for a 10x vision, but you get there through 0.1 iterations. To continuously learn, you have to co-develop with customers. It may be faster to build behind closed doors, but by testing ""skateboards"" you can learn if you're on the right path and gain the confidence needed to build a world-class experience.

We’re a remote-first company with core contributors in nearly ten countries and over twice as many cities. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, with an office available for anyone on the team to use at any time.

We’ll consider your application regardless of where you call home.

You're experienced and comfortable with being the ultimate data guardian of your organization. You strive for excellence when it comes to establishing high standards in company data hygiene and take proactive action to establish it. You naturally form and test theses against large data sets to help drive product decisions and company strategy.
